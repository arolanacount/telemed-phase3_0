What it is

* A browser-based app (phone/tablet/computer) where clinicians can:  
  * Log in securely  
  * View and update patient profiles  
  * Conduct telehealth consultations (video and/or audio)  
  * Record and store clinical encounters as structured medical records

What it’s used for

* Enabling remote consultations when patients can’t easily access in‑person care  
* Capturing complete visit history:  
  * Demographics and contact details  
  * Past medical history, current complaints, medications, surgeries  
  * Visit notes generated from recorded conversations using AI transcription  
* Providing a single, secure record that can be reused by multiple doctors over time  
* Supporting missions work (e.g., Christiana Friday missions) with consistent data capture

Impact / Why it matters

* Expands access to qualified doctors (including international volunteers) for patients in remote or disaster-affected areas  
* Reduces reliance on paper charts and fragmented records, improving continuity of care  
* Frees doctors to focus on the patient instead of typing, by using AI to structure notes  
* Lays the foundation for future integration with:  
  * Jamaican Ministry of Health systems  
  * Local pharmacies and labs  
  * Decision support (e.g., suggested diagnoses, labs, and medication safety checks)

   * Reason for visit / Chief complaint

   * Any required triage forms

   ### **Step 2 — Nurse Stops Recording but Note Stays Open**

1. Nurse stops the audio recording once intake is complete.

2. Note remains in **In Progress** state.

3. Nurse cannot close or finalize the note.

4. System logs:

   * Nurse as the initial contributor

   * Timestamp of intake completion

   ### **Step 3 — Provider Takes Over Note**

1. Provider logs into the application with their own credentials.

2. Provider navigates to:

   * “Open Visits”

   * Selects the patient’s visit in **In Progress** state.

3. Provider opens the existing note started by the nurse.

4. Provider may:

   * Resume audio recording

   * Add assessment details

   * Perform exam documentation

   * Add plan, diagnoses, follow-up instructions

   ### **Step 4 — Provider Completes & Closes Note**

1. Provider finishes all medical documentation.

2. Provider ends any additional recording segments.

3. Provider performs:

   * Final review

   * Sign-off

4. System changes note status to:

   * **Completed / Closed**

5. No further edits allowed unless:

   * Provider re-opens (if permissions allow)

   * Or addenda feature is enabled

   ---

   ## **4\. Multi-User Access Requirements**

* Only one user edits the note at a time (lock mechanism recommended).

* Each user must authenticate with their personal login.

* Audit trails must show:

  * Who added what content

  * Recording start/stop times

# Prototype MVP

**Low Fidelity Mockup**

**UI/UX Document Breakdown: [Telehealth \- Medical Record System](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1PAa0b8J5cFL0IH2CgjJMipm1aw1z7QstgaSP-HCsTZs/edit)**

A low-fidelity mockup is a **simple, early-stage design** that focuses on **structure, layout, and functionality** rather than fancy colors, icons or final visuals. It’s meant to show **what goes where** and how the user will move through the interface, without worrying about the pretty details yet. The mockups included in this document represent **key views** of the system: **mobile/phone version**.  
![][image3]![][image4]  
**Please note:** The icons, typography and visual styles vary across these design options,  this is intentional. It gives you a broader sense of direction and helps you decide what fits the brand personality, user needs and overall experience best.

Each variation explores a slightly different aesthetic,  whether it’s a cleaner medical look, a more modern tech-forward feel or something more friendly and human-centered.

# Team Sync \- 9/12/25

**Meeting Summary – ICF Telehealth Build Out**

The team aligned on building a **secure, web-based telehealth and medical records application** to support health missions in Jamaica, starting in Christiana.

**Purpose & Vision**

* Provide **virtual access to doctors** for patients in remote and storm-affected areas.  
* Replace or augment paper charts with a **secure electronic medical record (EMR)**.  
* Make the system an **“AI assistant” for doctors**, so they can focus on patients.

**Core MVP Scope (for Friday mission)**

* **Doctor login** via a web app (phones first; tablets later).  
* Ability to **add patients** and create a basic **patient record**.  
* **Record doctor–patient conversations** (audio) during visits.  
* Use **AI transcription \+ LLM** to:  
  * Turn recordings into text.  
  * Auto-fill a structured **patient form** (history, meds, problems, etc.).  
* Very simple but **secure storage** of medical records, compliant with Jamaican regulations.

**Telehealth & Workflow Considerations**

* Long-term: secure **video consultations** integrated with the record system.  
* Doctors should **look at the patient, not the tablet**; system does the documentation.  
* Future capabilities:  
  * Review prior visits, labs, meds before/during a consultation.  
  * AI suggestions for diagnoses, labs, meds, and safety checks (e.g., allergies).

**Regulatory & Strategic Points**

* Must comply with **Jamaican data protection and Ministry of Health rules**.  
* Likely model: **international doctors consult; Jamaican doctors prescribe**.  
* Need to ensure economic flows (pharmacies, services) stay within Jamaica.  
* Connectivity constraints: some areas lack internet but have **cell service**; telecom partnerships may be needed.

**Immediate Next Steps**

* **Dennis**: Create WhatsApp group for coordination.  
* **Ilya**: Share full list of required **patient data fields**.  
* **Shevanise givans**: Design initial **UI mockups** and send to Ilya for review.  
* **Team**: Meet **tomorrow at 2pm** to review UI and refine workflow.  
* **Ilya**: Available after **1pm tomorrow**; arriving **Thursday** in Jamaica.  
* **Daniel**: Speak with a **strategic partner** about positioning with the Ministry of Health.  
*

# Goals

# ICF TELEHEALTH \+ EMR PLATFORM

# **ICF TELEHEALTH \+ EMR PLATFORM**

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (Working Draft v1.0)

This document defines the functional, architectural, and clinical requirements for the Intellibus Care Foundation (ICF) Telehealth & EMR Platform.

The platform is designed as a **mobile-first clinical operating system** that unifies:

* Mobile acute care (“Treat & Release”)

* Nurse/medic field visits

* Telehealth physician oversight

* C5 traveler ingestion

* Inventory tracking for mobile units

* AI-driven documentation, coding, and analytics

* Public Health surveillance for Jamaica

* Offline-first reliability for low-connectivity environments

The system is not a traditional EMR. It is optimized for **rapid, distributed care delivery**, **AI-enabled documentation**, and **value reporting** (shadow billing) to quantify **hospital diversion impact** for partners such as the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) and Allianz.

---

# **1\. CORE CONCEPT MODEL (SYSTEM OVERVIEW)**

The platform connects 4 primary ecosystems:

### **1\. Inbound Travelers (C5 Integration)**

* Travelers complete “Enter Jamaica” form.

* System receives: Passport, Name, DOB, Traveler category, Payment metadata.

* A **Shadow Patient Profile** is pre-created before any care encounters.

### **2\. Mobile Medical Units**

* Field medics/nurses in SUVs, ambulances, or pop-up stations.

* Provide acute interventions: IV fluids, medications, wound care.

* Operate with onboard Starlink.

* Must function fully offline.

### **3\. Virtual Physicians**

* Provide oversight for Treat & Release.

* Approve field interventions.

* Document and sign visits.

* Must be able to review charts in real time.

### **4\. Public Health Command**

* Syndromic surveillance.

* Heat maps and disease clustering.

* De-identified analytics for Ministry of Health.

### **Mission-Critical Constraint**

**Platform must operate reliably in low-bandwidth environments with robust, append-only offline synchronization.**

**Product Vision: The "Clinical Flow" EMR**

**To:** Development Team (Dennis, Shevanise, Daniel) **From:** Ilya Rabkin **Date:** Dec 11, 2025 **Subject:** Refined UI/UX Requirements for Medical Record System

### **Core Philosophy: "State" over "Storage"**

We are not just building a database to store files. We are building a **Clinical Decision Tool**. When I open a chart, I need to immediately understand the **current state** of the patient without clicking five times. The design must support efficiency, flexibility, and trend analysis.

---

### **1\. The "Patient Snapshot" (The Dashboard)**

When I click on a patient (e.g., John Smith), the landing page must be a high-yield "Snapshot" that aggregates the most critical live data.

* **The "Must-Have" Widgets (visible immediately):**  
  * **Basic Demographics:** Name, Age, DOB.  
  * **Active Problem List:** The chronic conditions (e.g., "Diabetes," "Hypertension").  
  * **Current Medications:** The *live*, up-to-date list of what they are taking.  
  * **Recent/Pending Labs:** A quick view of results that just came in or are missing.  
  * **Action Items/To-Dos:** Reminders for me (e.g., "Needs flu shot," "Review MRI").  
  * **Last Visit Summary:** A concise text block showing the Assessment & Plan from the previous encounter.  
* **Deep Dive Navigation:**  
  * If I need to see more, I can use **Side Tabs** to dive deeper into specific histories (Social History, Family History, Full Lab Archive).

### **2\. The "Smart" Note & Medication Logic**

The Note and the Chart must be synchronized. I should not have to update the chart in two places.

* **Live Connection:** As I order a new medication or document "Stop Metformin" within my note, the system should automatically update the **Current Medications** list on the Snapshot.  
  * *Goal:* Seamless integration. No pop-ups if possible—just immediate execution of the order into the permanent record.  
* **Note Flexibility (Macros & Dot Phrases):**  
  * I need the ability to create "shortcuts." For example, if I type `.dia`, it should auto-expand into my standard diabetes exam template.  
  * Future State: Pre-built templates for specific visit types (Acute, Chronic, Wellness, Peds).  
* **"Copy Forward" Workflow:**  
  * For chronic care patients (who I see every 3 months for the same thing), I need a **"Clone Last Note"** button.  
  * *The AI Twist:* I clone the old note, and then I use the AI voice dictation to *edit* the deltas (changes) rather than starting from scratch.

### **3\. Review Mode & Navigation**

I need to be able to review the past while documenting the present.

* **Collapsible Sidebar:**  
  * When I am typing/dictating a note, I need a **Right-Side Sidebar** that displays the patient's history (Past Notes, Labs, Meds).  
  * This sidebar must be **collapsible**—I can pull it out to check a lab value from 6 months ago, then collapse it to reclaim screen space for my note.  
* **Historical Timeline:**  
  * I need an easy way to navigate to *any* past note.  
  * **Crucial:** This list must include **external/uploaded notes** (e.g., a PDF from a specialist referral). If a cardiologist sends me a letter, it should live in this timeline alongside my own notes.

### **4\. Data Visualization (Trends)**

* **Vitals Graphing:**  
  * Instead of a text list of blood pressure readings, display a simple **Line Graph**.  
  * Visualizing the trend (is it going up or down?) is clinically more valuable than the raw numbers.

5. **Exception Handling**

   * If medication is out of stock, pharmacist may:

     * Mark as “Backordered” and notify provider, or

     * Suggest alternative for provider approval.

---

### **4.8 Workflow H — Patient-Initiated App/Web Visit**

Supports a more modern, patient-facing flow.

1. Patient logs into app or web portal.

2. Selects desired service:

   * On-demand telehealth,

   * Scheduled telehealth, or

   * Request for home/mobile visit.

3. **For Telehealth Requests:**

   * Patient completes pre-visit questionnaire (symptoms, duration, meds, allergies).

   * Appointment is:

     * Put into virtual waiting room (on-demand), or

     * Scheduled for a defined time slot.

4. **For Home Visit Requests:**

   * System collects location and preferred time window.

   * Dispatch assigns mobile unit; visit appears in medic’s schedule.

5. Visit then proceeds via:

   * Workflow C (Telehealth-Only), or

   * Case enters a virtual waiting room/queue with:

     * Patient identity

     * Reason for visit

     * Triage priority (e.g., acute vs routine).

   * Physicians see prioritized list and pull next case when ready.

2. **Scheduled Telehealth Appointments**

   * Patients or staff can book a time slot with a physician.

   * Appointment appears on both:

     * Patient’s view (if patient-facing app is enabled).

     * Physician’s telehealth schedule.

   * At appointment time:

     * Patient joins waiting room,

     * Physician launches visit from schedule/queue.

3. **Configuration Options**

   * Ability to toggle features by phase/site:

     * Early phase: staff-driven telehealth (medic initiates).

     * Later phase: patient self-scheduling and direct waiting room entry.

---

### **5.3 Integration with Clinical Workflows**

* Telehealth sessions must be launchable from:

   * System generates a **printable/PDF requisition** with patient info, tests, and barcode/QR (if available).

2. **Patient Path 1: Patient Goes to Lab**

   * Patient takes paper/PDF to partner lab.

   * Lab staff confirm identity and manually register tests in their system.

   * When results are ready, lab:

     * Uploads PDF or sends via secure email, or

     * Enters results via a portal into the EMR (Phase 1.5).

3. **Patient Path 2: Mobile/Field Phlebotomist**

   * Phlebotomist visits patient location with mobile device.

   * Scans lab order barcode or searches patient/order ID.

   * Confirms tests, draws specimens, labels with unique accession ID(s).

   * Marks the order as “Collected” and, when appropriate, “In Transit.”

4. **Result Entry**

   * Lab uploads result PDF or inputs structured data.

   * AI Document Intelligence can:

     * OCR and extract values, reference ranges, flags.

     * Propose structured mapping for provider verification.

---

### **7.3 Future Phase — Direct Lab Integration**

When labs are integrated digitally:

1. Lab orders are transmitted electronically (API) to lab systems.

2. Lab system:

   * Receives order, assigns accession ID.

   * Updates status fields (Received, Processing, Resulted) via API callbacks.

3. Results are returned:

   * As structured data, mapped to internal lab test dictionary.

   * With reference ranges and abnormal/critical flags.

4. EMR must:

   * Attach results to the correct Visit and Lab Order.

   * Generate provider alerts for critical values.

   * Show longitudinal lab trends on the Patient timeline.

---

### **7.4 Phlebotomist Workflow (Explicit)**

1. Phlebotomist logs in (role-based view).

   * Opens the order, confirms patient identity (name \+ passport or other ID).

   * Confirms tests to be drawn.

   * Prints/uses digital labels/barcodes for tubes.

   * Marks status as “Collected.”

   * If transporting to central lab, marks “In Transit.”

4. If phlebotomist performs bedside tests or POCT:

   * Results may be entered immediately and marked “Resulted \+ Verified” depending on workflow.

5. The system must ensure:

   * Every collected specimen is traceable from order → collection → lab → result.

   * Minimization of lost/mismatched results via:

     * Unique accession IDs

---

### **14.3 AI Patient Triage & Self-Service Assistant (Patient-Facing Bot)**

A future virtual assistant that interacts directly with patients (via app, web, or messaging) to handle **basic, protocol-driven scenarios** and triage:

Capabilities:

1. **Symptom Intake & Triage**

   * Collects structured symptom data (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency for UTI-like symptoms).

   * Uses approved triage algorithms to decide whether:

     * This can be managed as low-acuity with deferred review.

     * The patient should be routed to same-day telehealth.

     * The situation is emergent and needs immediate ER/EMS referral.

2. **Basic Protocol-Driven Care Pre-Work**

   * For narrow, clearly defined issues (e.g., uncomplicated UTI in non-pregnant adult), the bot:

     * Gathers all necessary criteria (red flags, allergies, pregnancy status, etc.).

     * Pre-populates a recommendation and draft prescription for a human clinician to review and approve.

   * Clinician must:

     * Review conversation transcript.

     * Approve, modify, or decline suggested plan.

3. **Scheduling & Routing**

   * If not emergent but requires physician interaction:

     * Offers times for telehealth or clinic visit.

     * Or starts on-demand telehealth and places patient into waiting room.

4. **Emergency Detection**

   * Clearly defined triggers (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, unilateral weakness, confusion) escalate to:

     * “Stop chat and call emergency services” messaging, and/or

     * Direct routing to live nurse/dispatcher when available.

5. **Guardrails**

   * Restricted to pre-approved use cases and triage flows.

   * Always logged with full transcript.
