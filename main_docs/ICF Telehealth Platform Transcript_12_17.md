1:35 - Daniel Callaghan
Right, Dennis? I didn't hear that, bro.

1:38 - Dennis Wilmot
What did you say? Yeah, I'm basically telling them that you've been doing everything.

1:44 - Daniel Callaghan
They've been doing a good job and you've been managing everything. And you'll be managing things for a little while now. I also heard that the school... Erpida?

1:56 - Daniel Callaghan
Yeah, I'm also hearing that this quote from earlier might need to be adjusted as well I don't know how you guys feel about your scope or you guys feel right now about the current next version that you guys need to make.

2:13 - Daniel Callaghan
It's fine.

2:17 - Dennis Wilmot
Is it? Is it?

2:18 - Daniel Callaghan
We can discuss that another time.

2:19 - Dennis Wilmot
Okay, this call is for something else.

2:22 - Daniel Callaghan
My bad for invading guys. I'm gonna check out now because I'm at the bank big up good you guys doing a great job Justin big up yourself bro why the man a laugh why was he laughing uh nick how's it going bro did you I heard that you're rushing to finish the video portion how far did you You hear me?

2:55 - Dennis Wilmot
You hear me?

3:19 - Dennis Wilmot
Yeah, I can hear you.

3:23 - Dennis Wilmot
I was asking how far did you reach with the video, implementing the video?

3:33 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, I was making some changes, just now. Hold on.

3:44 - Unidentified Speaker
I was making, oh. Can you hear me now?

3:48 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, I can hear. Yeah, I can hear. Yeah, I was making some changes just now, but ran into some errors. So, won't be able to do a demo right away.

4:01 - Dennis Wilmot
Yeah, no problem, but like, what have you, where do you, what have you processed?

4:09 - Unidentified Speaker
Well, we can get an actual video call working between two, devices, peer-to-peer devices integrated into the app.

4:27 - Unidentified Speaker
So the main functionality of entering the video conference, that's what we have. Just to tailor it and add all the features that we need on the page, like the charts and stuff like that.

4:48 - Unidentified Speaker
You're muted, Ilya.

4:51 - Dennis Wilmot
You're muted, Ilya.

4:52 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, I clicked the wrong link. My apologies.

4:56 - Dennis Wilmot
Uh, no problem. Sorry about that. I was like, where is everybody? Uh, I'm in Manchester. No, no, no, no.

5:07 - Ilya Rabkin
I was, I clicked the wrong link and was waiting there. Thank you. But nevermind. We're all good. All right. How's everyone doing? I'm pretty good.

5:26 - Ilya Rabkin
All right. So thanks everyone for being here. I know we're just continuing the work on the Platform.

5:35 - Ilya Rabkin
Kind of leading off from the previous conversation about what happened on Friday and kind of take homes and learn So we're moving along. I took a look at that patient hub and Shevanise, thank you for putting that together, that was pretty cool.

5:53 - Ilya Rabkin
I guess what would make sense is maybe, I know I sent that printout of my thoughts and feedback, do you want to go over it now, kind of hearing what I have to say as we move through it, or what would you prefer I give you at this point?

6:15 - Dennis Wilmot
Yeah, uh, you can 70 can share the document and then we can just have you walk us through the feedback that you provided.

6:25 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, let me. What's up then?

6:32 - Ilya Rabkin
Or do you want me kind of But so we could go through the document or I could pull up the Platform.

6:38 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, you can pull it up on your screen and tell us like step by step what you like to change or what's looking kind of impressions.

6:47 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, the reason so let me I'll share my screen.

7:01 - Ilya Rabkin
All right. You all see where I am?

7:08 - Ilya Rabkin
So, nice and clean. So, I like this. So, this is kind of the initial dashboard for me, right? So, I'm Dr. Ilya. I log in and this is what I'm seeing. So, the initial thing I noticed So these three, so we have a calendar component, today's timeline, and my appointments for the day. So there feels like there's some redundancy here. So I have my appointments for the day, and I see that I'm not sure what today's timeline is.

7:58 - Ilya Rabkin
unless it somehow pulls in things like if I'm lecturing, if I'm away, then maybe, but then that would all be in this calendar. So I'm not sure if we need both of these.

8:12 - Shevanise Givans
Okay, so it would be better to take out the today's timeline and then leave the appointments?

8:21 - Ilya Rabkin
Can you tell me what you had in mind with this? Maybe you have thought that I'm just not thinking about that would make sense.

8:30 - Shevanise Givans
It was just like for hourly changes, although that does make sense. It's like a replica, like the appointments and then today's timeline. So the appointments would be patient based and then the today's timeline would be everything you have overall. I didn't want to like mix them, but that does make sense when it comes down to it being like a copy, you'd see it as a copy. So it would be in the calendar too. It can be removed. Yeah, okay.

8:57 - Ilya Rabkin
And then the one issue with having things like other things, other things, it means it would be pulling in from another calendar potentially. We just have to be careful with the security about that. But in theory, if it connects to like my personal Google calendar, then what in theory, if I'm working with someone that's scheduling appointments for me, they you know, like, oh, I can't schedule this for Dr. Atkin because he's giving a lecture, whatever. So that's kind of cool. Something to think through. It's not a must have, but depending if the security allows for it.

9:41 - Ilya Rabkin
Moving on here, this I didn't fully understand. So like patient like condition. So for, kind of an outpatient where we're out in the field, in a clinic, at a person's home, the stable, serious, fair, critical, I'm not fully understanding the utility. If and when we have this system set up for the hospital, potentially like emergency room doctors, ICU doctors, there may be a benefit of having patients flagged under different stability and conditions. And even then it gets tricky. So I'm not sure the purpose of it.

10:32 - Shevanise Givans
That was added. A workflow I was thinking about was when the nurse would be selecting the patient's condition to send it over into the meeting. So they would select that, hey, this person that's going to do the appointment, they're critical. So on your dashboard, able to see that, hey, this, you know, you have this person is coming over there, critical, stable, or fair, but I do understand what you're saying. So it's just a feature there in regards to you being able to tell like the overall, like patient list, like who's coming in and what they're coming with. But yeah.

11:08 - Ilya Rabkin
I see. I see. That makes it so what do you think, right? If there's this appointment list here, if this is sort of much like I'm seeing Amanda Kimber, the nurse roomed her, or whatever. And then green, yellow, red for stability.

11:29 - Shevanise Givans
So like, what we already have here, and then just embed it on the calendar, like the smaller letters and colors, maybe put it like, current done opening?

11:41 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, so something like, yeah, the HM already done, this patient is current or with a nurse or ready for provider. And then in the middle, you could have, if a nurse flags something she wants me to know, kind of put a red like critical, I don't know, we could think through that. That's not a bad idea. There's potential there for something.

12:08 - Ilya Rabkin
Generally, people who are going to be at health fair, we're going to their house, they're scheduled, they're generally not going to be critical, right? They're generally going to be stable enough to be sitting there waiting for us. So that's where the slight discrepancy comes in. But I like, there's potential there. I think that's an interesting thing we could add in a creative way.

12:41 - Ilya Rabkin
Yes, that's good. Then this, I'm guessing, is sort of I click on this appointment, it just gives me a quick little tab, right? You're right. Yeah, that's cool. This important updates, that's a cool thing to have. It pulls out health ministry information, any major office changes, anything. That's a nice thing. I would say it would be nice to move these widgets around, so maybe I can't calendar here and, you know, Dr. Dennis likes his calendar down here, whatever.

13:23 - Ilya Rabkin
The other thing, the search bar, you have it set to search patients, medication, diagnoses. So I was trying to say for a provider seeing patients, you really don't need to search or diagnoses, like I was struggling to find a use case. What did you have in mind?

13:47 - Shevanise Givans
And so in case, I don't want to say you forget the patient's name, but you know, you have a patient that uses this medication, you could type in the medication, it will pop up what cases have that medication in it. So instead of like, it's just like an alternative. So if you don't remember the patient's name, you could use a medication or the diagnosis you would have told the patient at the time.

14:09 - Ilya Rabkin
That makes, I see the problem there is in theory, if we have a huge system with thousands of patients, like hundreds of them are going to be on the same medicines. May not be as helpful. Um, generally we search by maybe patient date of birth name or their medical record number. Something more unique.

14:40 - Ilya Rabkin
What is interesting, I think, is for other views, like administrative views, for research purposes, public health views, someone could search by a diagnosis and get essentially data and demographics on how many people in our system have diabetes, how many people in our system are on other medications. But that might be more beneficial for a different view, not so much for the doctor seeing the patients.

15:19 - Ilya Rabkin
Where that may get complicated is if myself, Dr. Rabkin, I want to do everything.

15:28 - Ilya Rabkin
So one day I'm seeing patients and then tomorrow I'm doing an analysis of all the patients in Jamaica who have diabetes. No, that can cause problems, but maybe there's like a different view I would click where things just are targeted for the view. So if I'm wearing my business hat, I'm only seeing financial data from the system. If I'm wearing my public health hat, I'm getting only the dashboard that's set up for that. Because like this dashboard is just for a person treating patients at the moment.

16:19 - Shevanise Givans
All right.

16:22 - Ilya Rabkin
So this calendar I'm assuming you have there, it would pull up maybe like my weekly calendar, your view for my Yeah, I like that to have the ability to like expand on anything I like that that's good Then going into patients I'm assuming this is patients for the day, right? Yeah, okay.

16:50 - Shevanise Givans
So I go there.

16:51 - Ilya Rabkin
This is all my patients for the day So it's kind of like an expansion of this, but I just get more info right I like that.

17:02 - Ilya Rabkin
Is this the number of patients assigned to me? Is this total patients in the system? What is this?

17:12 - Shevanise Givans
It would be for you personally.

17:15 - Ilya Rabkin
So my own patients assigned to me for whatever reason.

17:21 - Shevanise Givans
Is there a use case where a doctor wants to see other outside of themselves or is it beneficial to just have your patients?

17:30 - Ilya Rabkin
So different scenarios. So sometimes, you know, if I have a clinic, I have patients that are mine, right? Dr. Rabkin is their doctor and they're assigned to him. Um, and that's it, but Dr. Rabkin is sick sometimes and someone might need to cover for him.

17:51 - Ilya Rabkin
So there are other times where another doctor like Dr. Dennis's patient will come see me because Dr. Dennis is busy.

18:06 - Ilya Rabkin
I see, so this is sort of like how many patients are truly assigned to me because I wanted to dive into all of them. Okay, so that's Maybe we label this My Patients.

18:21 - Ilya Rabkin
My Patients. And maybe this is better on the dashboard, because the dashboard is kind of my central command center. So maybe instead of this, we put My Patients.

18:45 - Ilya Rabkin
One of these could also be something called open charts. So it's possible, Dr. Atkin got lazy and didn't finish all his notes one day and went out with some friends. So I wouldn't know how many notes I still have to close.

19:03 - Shevanise Givans
Yeah, so the draft was to demonstrate that. So I could just change the name for the drafts. Oh, drafts.

19:12 - Ilya Rabkin
Oh, this.

19:17 - Shevanise Givans
This you mean?

19:21 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, just label it open notes or notes to sign or whatever. Yeah, if you don't do this, you're fired.

19:36 - Ilya Rabkin
But this would be good in the main dashboard as the big oversight. You guys can hear me right?

19:42 - Shevanise Givans
Navigation purposes.

19:44 - Unidentified Speaker
I wanted to know the between a chart, a visit, and a medical record, the correlation between them, and how we should have them correlate inside the system? Good question.

20:21 - Ilya Rabkin
Often, they're kind of interchanged when you're just discussing it. So, the medical record will be chart is generally referring to all of the information for one patient.

20:40 - Ilya Rabkin
So for you, your chart or your record would be all the notes that I saw you for, all your medications, all your history, all the labs. That's your chart. That's your record. A visit is a specific instance or a specific encounter. So you can call it an encounter. So that's when Nicholas saw Dr. Rabkin yesterday. And everything that was done for that encounter is the visit. And the visit is part of the larger chart or record.

21:22 - Ilya Rabkin
Does that answer your question? If not, I can clarify.

21:31 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, that's making sense now.

21:33 - Nicholas McKay
So when we're building a patient profile, basically what a patient will have is a chart to keep record of all interactions with that patient. And then a visit is for specific instances or specific interactions between patient, doctor, patient, nurse. Yeah, or patient. Yeah, we're patient.

22:07 - Ilya Rabkin
Any other questions?

22:18 - Ilya Rabkin
Did I lose people?

22:24 - Dennis Wilmot
You guys still there?

22:30 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, sorry.

22:31 - Ilya Rabkin
I think maybe my connection went weird. Anyone have any questions or should I move on?

22:41 - Ilya Rabkin
You can proceed. And you guys just interrupt if you have questions as I'm going.

22:48 - Ilya Rabkin
Let's see. Daena, hold on, let me look.

22:56 - Ilya Rabkin
Where is the chat? So Daena, you're asking, do we need to differentiate between types of visit, first time, follow up?

23:07 - Ilya Rabkin
Good question. Potentially, there are going to be different kind of visit types, so encounter types. Generally, a first time versus a follow follow up, you generally don't need to really distinguish between that. But you would potentially need to distinguish between a nursing visit where a person just saw a nurse for whatever reason, a vaccine, a blood pressure check, something simple. When they're seeing a provider, there are different visit types. So there's one type that's your wellness visit, that's kind of yearly checkup. It's geared to just kind of do everything, basic labs. There's your sick visit type, you know, sore throat, UTI, whatever, something quick, simple. It's called a sick visit or it's called an acute visit, A-C-U-T-E.

24:08 - Ilya Rabkin
Then there's a chronic care, which is sort of for the patients who are following up you know, who have diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and that visits just to review those chronic diseases. So there are different visit types. The reality or practical reality for most doctors is that often patient comes in for one thing and you end up doing all the above sometimes, but that's okay. So normally that visit type gets put in when that visit is scheduled. So you kind of know beforehand, either the doctor schedules it or a nurse schedules it or however it gets scheduled in the system. It's usually, okay, we're here for your general yearly checkup. Oh, you want to see a doctor because you're sick. Oh, you're following up the medications and your visits. That's sort of how that gets triaged.

25:11 - Ilya Rabkin
All right. Thanks, Anna. That was a good question.

25:15 - Ilya Rabkin
All right. I'll continue. So, okay, we're back on this. So this is the today's patient's view. We talked about this, moving that.

25:29 - Ilya Rabkin
So this info for the individual patients, overall pretty good. I'm assuming the current issue is either why they're here, so I'm kind of referring to Daena's question about the visit type. Maybe that's, oh, sorry.

25:57 - Ilya Rabkin
So the current issue, why they're here, I'm guessing.

26:04 - Ilya Rabkin
Is that correct or do you have something else in mind?

26:08 - Shevanise Givans
the reason for the current issue.

26:11 - Ilya Rabkin
So we could recategorize that, um, because usually they have multiple issues. So you could say, you know, chronic care, followup, medication, refill, followup, sick visit, whatever. And then medication. So we could keep this. Um, the reality is a lot of people will be on multiple, um, So it may not necessarily need to be there, or if you want to keep like a scroll option, you could do that. But this quick view is nice.

26:49 - Shevanise Givans
And it has the drag thing you're mentioning. It's not established everywhere, but if you drag, it moves. So if you put her over there, they switch.

27:02 - Ilya Rabkin
So that's more important here. Here, it might get confusing. It may make more sense to have them in order of when they're coming.

27:18 - Ilya Rabkin
And what I would say to have kind of a status similar to here, kind of saying, you know, finished or the patient left or patients with a nurse or ready for the top or whatever the low is at the moment having more of that view.

27:41 - Shevanise Givans
Drop down right there. Status, I guess it should just be bigger, right? So you could click to change.

27:50 - Shevanise Givans
So put it up there more visible.

27:56 - Shevanise Givans
No, so this is sorry.

27:57 - Ilya Rabkin
That's a good placement. We would just need to change these options.

28:04 - Ilya Rabkin
This would make sense for more like to highlight kind of, you know, patient didn't show up. So like if a patient with a nurse or patient ready, which tells the doctor, the nurse is already done with them and they're just waiting on me. And then I would go and click with the doctor. And so the nurse knows that's, that's more of a workflow like a traditional office clinic setting, which we may still want to keep.

28:38 - Ilya Rabkin
That has its use. It may not always fit into the health fair model or the home mobile visit, but that's okay. That kind of reminds me that another visit type might be home visit. That's its own potential. Visit note type.

29:00 - Ilya Rabkin
And so, okay, so then I'm going to see this patient. So, good view, basic overview here, different tabs. It would be nice to collapse this one and or bring it back if I want to go back to my dashboard. I'd want to be able to it disappear so I have more. And then, okay, so this is a basic overview of the patient's charts. I would love the vitals to be higher, especially if like this is a vital the nurse just did for this patient right now. It would be nice if this is more front and centered.

29:49 - Ilya Rabkin
And then this I'm assuming is like get the patient's background. So if I wanted to dive in to their vitals or like, huh, what are their, all of their allergies? What are all their medications, all their vaccines, problems, family history? This makes sense. Surgical, past medical. These would be like their diagnoses that I put in. Screening makes sense. It kind of, maybe it's flags and tells me, hey, this patient is due for their prostate cancer screening. So I don't forget. That's a nice little reminder of what's been done, what's not been done, colonoscopies kind of with the dates. So that's nice. Quality measures has a potential benefit like what should I be considering for this patient? That's helpful. These three things, history of present illness is essentially what we call like the stories. When I'm talking to Dennis, Hey, Dennis, sorry I'm picking on you, but like, why are you here? Dennis tells me, you know, I'm here because I have a sore throat for three days. I tried honey, it didn't help. That's the history of present illness. So this really shouldn't be here. That's a component of the actual note. Same for review of systems and potentially this. What did you have in mind when you put this here? I can understand better.

31:17 - Shevanise Givans
Yeah, it's just like while doing checks, I noticed that that would be important information, but you're the doctor, so you would know, you know, whether or not it's needed. So it's face value. So the issue of the present illness and stuff. So I understand what you're saying in regarding to the placement. So yeah. So I think, okay, maybe I'll back up.

31:37 - Ilya Rabkin
Was this meant to be the Components of the actual Note that I'm creating Right as I'm seeing this patient or this was meant to be more details about the patient's full chart story more details This large view to give you light of fronting information and this would go in depth So this should be actually a pop-up but yeah, okay. No, so that's I imagined it so really this is um this menu I click in here and it gives me all their medications that they're currently on this you know gives me all their diagnoses that they have right so everything from the chart so that I like that that's correct so but in that case these things history present almost review a system shouldn't be there okay Okay, the rest of this looks good. And then really, it's the question, okay, it's their chart. How do I, where is it start the note? Is this what you meant by that register visit?

32:50 - Shevanise Givans
So for like a current visit, you click that and then the recording thing will come in. It'll be that one. I see.

32:57 - Ilya Rabkin
So this is what starts the visit. We could add a different button if you like, No, register.

33:09 - Ilya Rabkin
This is maybe a stylistic thing, and I'd love to hear what other people think. When I see register, it makes me think like, not starting the note, but they're registering with front desk. Oh, okay. That's what it makes me think. So I think it's just a wording thing, but I don't I don't know what other people think about it.

33:39 - Ilya Rabkin
Any opinions, feel free.

33:46 - Shevanise Givans
No, no one has opinions.

33:48 - Ilya Rabkin
Let's follow your lead.

33:56 - Dennis Wilmot
Fair, but it's good.

33:57 - Ilya Rabkin
I mean, I'm one person and one person's opinion. Sometimes other people have cool ideas. So please let me know, but we'll also make sure other doctors evaluate this soon too. So it's not just me, because I may be missing something. We're not thinking of something, right? No one's perfect. Okay, so then if no one has an opinion, I would say change the wording.

34:22 - Ilya Rabkin
So you click this, maybe start a video. We could add GPT for a better wording.

34:31 - Ilya Rabkin
And then once I click this, the visit starts, right? And that's where I could click record and it populates, right? And that's the next step. This is just the first dashboard draft. That's nice.

34:52 - Ilya Rabkin
going back to the the other conversation from Monday that when I start the visit this would pull in any information the nurse did for this day's visit encounter correct? Could you repeat that please? So I think Monday we talked about how things are happening in parallel right so the nurse potentially all right saw Martin Koblin right did his vitals, asked him what he's here for, double checked his medications, whatever. And so when I start the visit, some of that will be already populated. So like, the reason that would be populated by something the nurse put in previously, from her login, and I have the ability to change it, because oftentimes what they tell the nurses and what they tell the doctor, whatever and then populate we would have whatever up-to-date medications that the nurse reconciled. Some nurses will also take a history for the doctor so that could populate but still the doctor should be able to edit it and the doctor's recording should be able to change that if necessary because unfortunately patients will tell you one story and another story.

36:20 - Ilya Rabkin
So that happens. So does that make sense? Because that was the workflow we talked about a bit on Monday. Yes, I get what you're saying.

36:27 - Shevanise Givans
So there would be a portion to show their notes already seen as it have already been started. And then you're able to go in there and do any changes if necessary. If I get through that part.

36:38 - Ilya Rabkin
Changes and additions, my physical exam, just the rest of what a doctor would normally do compared to what like a nurse would traditionally do.

36:50 - Ilya Rabkin
And then, for that note, like we talked about, it would have to remain open. So, like, I could go into it 10 million times until I sign it and close it.

37:04 - Ilya Rabkin
So, is there any, so I'm not sure, is there any other part of this draft hub that I didn't venture into?

37:12 - Shevanise Givans
So, you have, you're mentioning the thing about the training at the EIA analysis. You should look at the past visits and kind of give you an overview of what he thinks. And then you will come up with your final observation. So that will be for the health trends and analysis portion. So that's what I gathered when you were telling me. So I'm not sure if this is what you're picturing. Say that again. I didn't quite follow right away.

37:38 - Ilya Rabkin
So you're talking about this.

37:41 - Shevanise Givans
So you had mentioned that in your previous systems, you would see the However, you wanted like the AI to go in and compare and then give you like that analysis. So that's what this is. So is it what you pictured? Like, should I change anything? Kind of So like the weight is down.

38:01 - Ilya Rabkin
I'm assuming this is analysis of it's down from the most recent visit that we have.

38:09 - Shevanise Givans
That's cool.

38:11 - Ilya Rabkin
I like that.

38:14 - Ilya Rabkin
What I would love also is to expand on this and maybe like, I look at the last year and I see how the wave is going up or down, et cetera, like a pattern, like a graph pattern.

38:32 - Ilya Rabkin
This is nice, having the AI kind of tell me this. That's cool. A little bit of an insight, what they think. From the first analysis. That's that's a cool little feature And then the visit for Sean top top So you're mentioning you wanted to see the last ones is this what you Yeah, so this is one view it would also be good to have it on the side tab and Yeah, so this is one place to have it. Sometimes docs are annoying and they like to do things different ways. So, you know, having visit history here somewhere and here is fine.

39:28 - Shevanise Givans
Just different ways of getting to the same thing, I guess.

39:32 - Ilya Rabkin
So moving is fine.

39:38 - Ilya Rabkin
Kind of yeah And this generally when I clicked on these visits from like this was a past encounter Generally have more information. This would have this particular encounters story and Anything I did physical exam the diagnoses Medications prescribed but they would be in kind of them. There's an assessment and plan format. But this is good. Or is this just the summary of that visit? And I could click into it and it expands into details.

40:22 - Shevanise Givans
So this was just overarching view. But I guess I understand what you're saying. So it should be more detailed. There would be more information. In general, right?

40:35 - Ilya Rabkin
Like, you know, when you last went to the doctor and all the things they did, the physical exam, everything that gets all documented and that's the encounter. So, so these are the individuals just quick thing, medications prescribed. That's great. But if I go into it, like maybe I want to see what exactly I thought of about their heart exam. And I just want to like, wait, what did I, did I hear something last time or not? So we want to see that. So it's... I'm sorry to cut you off.

41:08 - Shevanise Givans
You mentioned like a farm, like a formatted way of doing that. Is it possible for us to get that so I could duplicate that over here? Yeah, like how...

41:20 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, I can give you that format. And that's sort of related to having the AI map things out. I can give you an example format. Yeah, I can do that. Thank you.

41:39 - Ilya Rabkin
And then orders. So, orders in my tab, is this for this visit?

41:54 - Ilya Rabkin
Because I haven't started the visit here. This is just a general have of this patient. So what did you have in mind here?

42:00 - Shevanise Givans
That was just like the general stuff. So anything that would have occurred, like all the orders. So this could also be placed over to the follow tab with all those other ones.

42:14 - Shevanise Givans
Here's my thought.

42:16 - Ilya Rabkin
If I'm just generally, so what, what can happen? I think in the new updated feedback, I discussed this a little bit. So maybe it's good for me to talk about it.

42:30 - Ilya Rabkin
I'm a provider, you know, whatever, sitting at home on the weekend or weekday. And again, I'm not where I'm just reviewing the patient chart and I see a message the nurse sent like, hey, Martin Koblen is due for a refill of his, you know, blood pressure medication. So then I should be able to go into the chart and look without starting a visit, just add an order. I want to order lisinopril. So I could do that here. Having it here as well is helpful. So like, again, different ways of doing the same thing.

43:09 - Ilya Rabkin
Because there is a workflow where I'm ordering blood work, refilling a medication when I'm not exactly seeing a patient. I think of any time you may have called your own doctors to be like, hey, I'm running out of this medicine. Can you fill it? They're not necessarily starting a new note for that. They're just going in your chart and sending over a medication.

43:34 - Ilya Rabkin
OK, I understand. And then inside the note where the AI is recording in there, I should be able to put in orders as well. Because when I do it in the visit note, it kind of records, Dr. Rabkin ordered lisinopril during this visit. When I do it inside the visit, it should still know when that was done, but it won't be attached to a specific live encounter or whatever. Does that make sense?

44:11 - Shevanise Givans
Please ask questions.

44:12 - Ilya Rabkin
If it doesn't quite, I'd rather you ask more questions being uncertain.

44:20 - Ilya Rabkin
All right.

44:27 - Ilya Rabkin
So that's talk about that. And then messages from patients. What would be good is if there are messages for to kind of like flag, like a little red flag or 1, 2, 3, 4, so it kind of says like, oh, there's actual messages waiting for me. All right. Yeah, that could be, let's see something. Yeah, that could be here. That makes sense. That makes sense for it to be here because it's on top and it lets me know there's been messages.

45:01 - Shevanise Givans
Okay, the only last thing left would be the video call thing. In the profile, if you click it. Yeah, it would pop up. You're saying you wanted it to be there. This is just like a transition.

45:20 - Ilya Rabkin
So it would be there.

45:23 - Shevanise Givans
And Nicholas has the prototype for that. So he's going to show you soon. So you mentioned that you wanted the video to be going and you're doing the notes alongside it.

45:37 - Ilya Rabkin
I could move this around like a picture in picture.

45:43 - Shevanise Givans
Yeah, he has like a demonstration of what it's going to look like, Yeah, so you can see it's gonna be like this, but he has like a working thing going currently.

45:55 - Ilya Rabkin
Okay, no, perfect. And then so in terms of the workflow for the You know, I guess this makes sense because I'm thinking out loud. A patient is here, if they're in, if they're scheduled for a video visit, they're not necessarily physically in the office, they're at home, they then, I would be in their chart, and I'd be ready to start the visit. I'd still start the visit note, but then I would just have to click this as well to connect to them and they would have the link that would connect right through their Platform.

46:51 - Shevanise Givans
Yeah, so would it be a case for it to once you open like the video call, then the note just automatically does that? So instead of you like Starting the note, then starting the video. Once you click the video, it just pops up. Yeah, we could do that.

47:10 - Ilya Rabkin
I don't know if it's possible, like if the Platform, like if this knew that today's visit is a scheduled video visit, like that's another note type video visit.

47:24 - Ilya Rabkin
This could say start video visit.

47:29 - Ilya Rabkin
click it, and it opens up the video and the note. Is that what you're saying?

47:34 - Shevanise Givans
Yeah, I'm not sure if, like, technically, if they could make that work. So technical people can make it look good.

47:46 - Unidentified Speaker
I'm not sure if it will work. Yeah, technically, it could work. It could work like that.

47:55 - Ilya Rabkin
So that's one way. It would mean system has to know this visit was marked as it was scheduled as a video visit specifically and we have to plan for potential errors right so let's say I start this visit with Martin Koblin and it's a video visit but his service is out so I still should be able to if I can't do the video visit either I call him and figure it out or something, but it's possible we could still do the visit in some other creative fashion. I would just have to document, as I'm talking about this visit, the video did not work or whatever. Yeah, there's, again, there's gonna be multiple ways of doing kind of the same thing depending on the workflow, etc.

48:53 - Shevanise Givans
All right, so I wanted to know, do you guys generally email patients? Because I just, I put the tags there, because those are like the possible means of communication. I'm not sure if you guys would like, you know, click on email patient or click and call the patient or that side. Yeah, so it depends. Like, yeah, there's some way I send messages to patients.

49:17 - Ilya Rabkin
Some systems just integrate it where this This message, when I write a message to a patient, it sends it as an email to them. That's one way. There's other systems where if I write a message, it keeps it in this and the patient gets an alert. Dr. Rabkin has sent you a message on Intellibus medical Platform. So they have to log into their patient portal. And see the message.

49:53 - Shevanise Givans
There are other kinds of messages actually.

49:56 - Ilya Rabkin
So there's messages between doctors and patients. There's messages between nurses and patients. There's messages between nurses and doctors, pharmacists and doctors, pharmacists and nurses. So sometimes nurses will need to send me a message, like maybe it's not urgent, so they don't need to call me, but they're like, hey, just a reminder, Martin Koblin called, he's waiting to see his lab results, or he needs a refill of something, like pharmacy called and you need a refill, Lucinapril for him. So there's different kinds of message types as well.

50:39 - Ilya Rabkin
Yes, Nicholas.

50:45 - Ilya Rabkin
All right.

50:46 - Nicholas McKay
So what I'm getting is you'd like to have like a separate messages or messaging tab somewhere on the left that gives you access to all of that.

50:56 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, it could be somewhere here if it's specifically for the patient or here where it's just a generic messaging area. Where I see patient messages, labs, messages from nursing, or somehow there's a cleaner, there's a clean way of doing that. But some medical systems do it that way, where the general messages are here.

51:25 - Nicholas McKay
Okay, I got that.

51:35 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, and that'll expand And that can get complicated and robust. If you want to get really fancy, I think Epic has a live chat option where I could really chat with a nurse or message a doctor in the system.

51:55 - Ilya Rabkin
side chat. I mean, it's a cool feature. It's not definitely a future.

52:22 - Shevanise Givans
Okay, I only have one other thing left to say. So I was going through your notes at the end, you had mentioned that during the visit, right, there will be like the AI integrated, it's listening, and it will give you, let's say, recommendations. I wanted some clarity on in the sense of, we were just thinking about it out loud, you know, or doctors having the AI tell it that, hey, this is what's possibly going on. Like, it's like a good use case, but is there, would it be okay if we put like some dialogue there to say, the doctor actually reviewed this information? You know, I trust the doctors, but you know, I don't want it to be a case where they just go by what they see, the AI say, they're going to like, you know, look it over or something like that.

53:17 - Shevanise Givans
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, ultimately, the doctor has to make the call.

53:22 - Ilya Rabkin
So I guess what I was thinking is like, the AI, you know, records does the note, right. And then later, or right then and there, the doctors, you know, diagnosis, something. So there's, okay, Hold on. There's different ways of thinking about this. There's one suggestion, maybe like a button that says, give me the differential. Let's say the doctor doesn't know the patient, just gave them a whole story of something really unique, and the doctor's not sure. Maybe there's a cool thing of like recommendations, and the AI says, Consider these diagnoses. These are possible things to consider ordering to like do the valuation. So that's one thing. And then the doctor ultimately decides to listen or not. So that's the check, right? Just because the AI recommended it doesn't mean it has to go into the note. The doctor can say, okay, for this headache, the AI just said, order an MRI. Well, maybe not yet. Maybe I'll try giving them a Tylenol first.

54:42 - Ilya Rabkin
So then the doctor would then order it or not order it. That's a cool feature, especially if the AI makes that recommendation. And let's say the AI recommended, I would do Tylenol first. And if after a few weeks, it doesn't improve, maybe order the MRI. Doctor will just click on the Tylenol and the Tylenol goes into the order section of the note.

55:14 - Ilya Rabkin
So that's one way of looking at it. Another is like, okay, I just spoke to you and I'm like, oh, you have a UTI. So I put in diagnosis UTI and then the AI somewhere like, hey, for UTI, consider this antibiotic. And the doctor could click on it to acknowledge, and then it gets put into the order. Or they're like, no, I don't want this antibiotic for X, Y, Z reasons. And the AI maybe would make that recommendation because of knowing the patient's allergies and knowing resistant and like bacterial resistant patterns, whatever. That's really cool features.

56:13 - Shevanise Givans
I don't know if that really answered your question.

56:15 - Ilya Rabkin
I may have just gone off on a tangent. Yes, it did.

56:19 - Shevanise Givans
It did.

56:19 - Ilya Rabkin
Yes, it did. And ultimately, those orders that are put in, even if it's clicked from a recommendation or like the AI makes a lab recommendation, The orders aren't officially sent until the doctor signs everything, right? So ultimately, doctor has to review it all and then sign and then all that gets done. At the end of the day, the doctor is obligated to review and once they sign, they put their signature on everything and all those orders get sent.

57:09 - Ilya Rabkin
Yeah, that's it for me.

57:10 - Shevanise Givans
I don't have anything else. I just work on the notes, but yeah, that's it for me.

57:17 - Ilya Rabkin
Any questions from anyone else? All right, do we...

57:27 - Nicholas McKay
Yeah, for the patient profiles, for unique identifiers, At first we'll be using like generating a medical or a patient record ID, for example, right? Will we get a point where we'll be using like patient IDs, for example, as persistent unique identifiers or not?

57:57 - Nicholas McKay
I don't know.

57:58 - Ilya Rabkin
That's something something to look into. I think most medical records systems just create a patient ID for them. They don't use their actual, like, license IDs. So I haven't seen that method.

58:23 - Nicholas McKay
I needed some clarification on that.

58:27 - Ilya Rabkin
We could consider it. We would need to just think of the benefits of it and the downsides of doing it that way. Because when the patient gets registered into the system for the first time, someone puts their name, date of birth, who they are, getting an ID is generally part of the process. And we have their ID number, so that could be their chart ID. But I don't know if there's any kind of legal or security issue about doing that versus just generating a record ID number?

59:06 - Nicholas McKay
All right, so what I was concerned is potentially we might run into a situation where we have like a duplicate for one patient in the system. For example, let's say and there is a patient that was put in the system by the previous staff. Patient returns but for some reason he doesn't know his patient ID that was generated. How would we then identify that specific patient? Great question.

59:41 - Ilya Rabkin
So there should be a stopgap there. So Martin Koblin comes in as a new person, gets registered, A month later, he comes back.

59:53 - Ilya Rabkin
Generally, if the person registering him doesn't think to look him up, as they're putting in his info, the system should be like, hey, this person already exists.

1:00:14 - Ilya Rabkin
Was that possible?

1:00:18 - Nicholas McKay
Is that possible?

1:00:21 - Nicholas McKay
Yeah, providing his information is persistent, but what if like his phone number changes, for example?

1:00:28 - Ilya Rabkin
Well, his name and date of birth shouldn't change.

1:00:36 - Nicholas McKay
Okay, so the date of birth is what we're really using to more uniquely identify expressions. I guess that makes sense.

1:00:48 - Ilya Rabkin
I mean, I'm trying to see. I don't know how it's done in most sense, but I know there's generally a stopgap. To prevent that an email potentially. I know you often in most systems like if I put my email and all of a sudden the systems like all this email already exists, but emails can change. People could create new emails.

1:01:09 - Ilya Rabkin
It is possible. We are taking more information than just name and date of birth. We may be taking in their government ID as well. That might be necessary for certain things like sending medications. So, that could be the other unique identifier because we will have their ID number. And that could be a stopgap to say, like, oh, this patient already exists. You know, this name, date of birth, or patient ID already exists in the system.

1:01:46 - Nicholas McKay
Okay, yeah that path is making sense.

1:01:50 - Ilya Rabkin
And if for some reason even with that, that fails somehow, and we know that, there should be a way to merge charts.

1:02:02 - Ilya Rabkin
Like just in case, maybe that's not a terrible thing to do. Because if there's somehow that's the system still misses it and somehow allows a new chart to be created and now there's two do the same thing, there should be a mechanism of merging. And that could be something an administrator has to do or something.

1:02:31 - Ilya Rabkin
Now that we're are starting to really build this out. Would it make sense to maybe have a team, a front-end, a back-end person, plus minus me, to do demos with some of the medical record systems out there and just see what they're like and trying to get best practices? Like I mentioned Epic and Athena, those are big ones. Cerner, like they'll do demos if they think we're about to buy their system, and we could just at least get a quick idea. Maybe we can't ask them every question we want, but we could kind of see some of their flows, and we just pretend we're going to buy their system. What do you guys think of that idea? All right. Yeah, that sounds good.

1:03:31 - Unidentified Speaker
Could you please schedule the demo and just add us to the call?

1:03:40 - Ilya Rabkin
I could try reaching out and scheduling those demos. How available would you guys be and who should I include on that meeting?

1:03:53 - Ilya Rabkin
Do you know how many people are allowed? Probably not much but maybe I could maybe make an argument for one or two and I could just say like I'm the business owner and like me Nicholas is my office manager, and he needs to see this as well.

1:04:15 - Ilya Rabkin
There has to be some logic. So maybe up to two extra people I could make sense. I don't know. Maybe they'll allow everyone, but I doubt it. I think they might think it's weird. Actually, I had a demo scheduled Yeah, so I mean, I could be on those calls.

1:05:03 - Ilya Rabkin
it's also possible there might be a demo on YouTube. Yeah, I was looking into that as well. Yeah, so if you scheduled that demo, let me know and I can try to be there.

1:05:30 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, no problem.

1:05:33 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, and it's good to maybe do a few of them.

1:05:36 - Ilya Rabkin
We don't need all of them, but at least to get an idea of how the different systems work and try to scale the best ideas.

1:05:50 - Ilya Rabkin
So let me know if you want me to set it up or if you already started setting up, just include me on the meeting and I'll make sure I'll be there. Unless something's going on.

1:06:01 - Dennis Wilmot
I think it'd be great if you would own that part of it.
