Ilya Rabkin and Shevanise Givans engaged in a thorough examination of the patient hub design, identifying redundancies between the calendar and timeline features. Ilya raised concerns about the utility of patient condition indicators in outpatient settings, while Shevanise clarified their purpose in helping providers assess patient stability prior to appointments. The conversation also touched on improving search options for providers, emphasizing the need for unique identifiers in a large database and the potential for tailored views based on user roles.

The team discussed the patient profile system, which tracks various types of visits, including wellness, sick, and chronic care visits. Ilya noted the common occurrence of patients discussing multiple issues in a single appointment and addressed the need for differentiating between first-time and follow-up visits. The conversation highlighted the practical aspects of patient interactions and the importance of categorizing visits effectively to enhance workflow visibility. Ilya proposed improvements to the patient chart interface, including clearer displays of patient status and vital signs.

Further discussions included the integration of video calls into the platform's workflow, with suggestions for automatically opening video calls and visit notes during scheduled appointments. Shevanise raised questions about communication methods with patients, leading to a discussion on messaging systems and the potential for a dedicated messaging tab. The team also considered the implications of AI-generated recommendations in patient consultations, emphasizing the necessity for doctors to review these suggestions before implementation. Ilya proposed strategies to prevent duplicate patient records and suggested organizing demos with established medical record systems to learn best practices.


Chapters & Topics:

Project Updates and Video Implementation
Daniel Callaghan praised the work of Daena, Nick, and Chevron, indicating that they should coordinate with Dennis for updates. Dennis Wilmot confirmed his oversight of the project and asked Nick about the status of the video implementation. Nick mentioned that while they had established peer-to-peer video calls, he encountered errors that delayed a demo.
* Feedback on the current version of the platform and necessary adjustments.

Feedback on Patient Hub Design
Ilya Rabkin reviewed the patient hub design, noting redundancy between the calendar and today's timeline features. Shevanise Givans explained that the timeline was meant to display overall daily activities, but Ilya suggested it might be unnecessary. They also discussed the utility of patient condition indicators, with Ilya expressing uncertainty about their relevance in outpatient settings.
* Integration of video call features within the patient management system.

User Interface and Functionality Discussion
Ilya Rabkin raised questions about the search functionality in the telehealth platform, particularly regarding the relevance of searching by medication or diagnosis for providers. Shevanise Givans explained that this feature could help when a provider cannot recall a patient's name. Ilya suggested that unique identifiers would be more effective in a large system, while also proposing different views for administrative and public health purposes.
* Discussion on the functionality and layout of the patient dashboard.

Patient Profile and Visit Types Discussion
Ilya Rabkin explained the concept of patient profiles, which document all interactions with patients. He outlined various visit types, including wellness visits for yearly checkups, sick visits for acute issues, and chronic care visits for ongoing health conditions. Rabkin acknowledged that while visit types are typically predetermined, patients may address multiple concerns in one appointment.

Discussion on Patient Chart Overview and Workflow Enhancements
Ilya Rabkin and Shevanise Givans addressed the need for better categorization of patient visits, such as chronic care and medication refills. Ilya emphasized the importance of displaying patient status clearly and suggested that vital signs should be more prominent in the interface. Shevanise acknowledged the need for adjustments based on Ilya's feedback regarding the placement of certain information.

Discussion on Visit Registration and Workflow
Ilya Rabkin expressed his thoughts on the terminology for starting a visit, suggesting that "register" could be misleading. Shevanise Givans clarified that clicking the button would initiate the visit and allow for recording. Ilya also mentioned the need for input from other doctors to ensure the terminology is appropriate and effective.

Feedback on Draft Hub Features
Ilya Rabkin and Shevanise Givans reviewed the draft hub's functionality, focusing on the analysis of patient visits and health trends. Ilya requested more detailed information on past encounters, including physical exams and medications, while Shevanise suggested ways to present this data effectively. They also discussed the importance of having multiple access points for patient information.

Video Call Integration in Telehealth Workflow
Ilya Rabkin and Shevanise Givans focused on the implementation of video calls within the telehealth platform. They considered how the system could automatically open a video call and corresponding visit notes simultaneously when a scheduled video visit is initiated. Ilya raised concerns about potential technical limitations and the need for the system to recognize scheduled video visits.

Communication Methods in Telehealth
Shevanise Givans asked about the communication methods with patients, highlighting the tagging system for options like email and phone calls. Ilya Rabkin elaborated on different messaging types, including communications between doctors, nurses, and patients, and mentioned the need for a dedicated messaging tab for better organization. Nicholas McKay acknowledged this suggestion.

AI Integration in Telehealth Consultations
Shevanise Givans expressed the need for clarity on how AI recommendations would be integrated into the doctor's decision-making process during patient visits. Ilya Rabkin proposed functionalities where AI could suggest diagnoses and treatment options, but ultimately, the doctor would have the authority to accept or reject these recommendations. He highlighted that any orders generated from AI suggestions would require the doctor's review and signature before being finalized.
* The role of AI in assisting with patient notes and recommendations during visits.

Discussion on Patient Identification and System Demos
Nicholas McKay expressed concerns about identifying returning patients who may not remember their unique patient ID, prompting Ilya Rabkin to propose a system that uses multiple identifiers, including name, date of birth, and possibly government ID. They discussed the importance of having a mechanism to merge duplicate records if necessary. Ilya also suggested conducting demos with established medical record systems to gather best practices.
* Mechanisms for preventing duplicate patient records in the system.


Action Items:

* Ilya Rabkin will share a format for documenting patient notes to ensure consistency in the system.
* Ilya Rabkin will reach out to schedule demos with medical record systems to gather best practices.


Key Questions:
