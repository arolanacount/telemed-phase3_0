symptom descriptions, mood and sleep reports - Objective Data:
observable signs, mental status findings, vitals if relevant, test
results - Session Content: topics discussed, interventions used,
homework reviewed, documents reviewed (records, labs) - Collateral
Data: family/caregiver input, other provider notes - Rating Scales and
Measures: PHQ-9, GAD-7, functional assessments, pain scores

**A -- Assessment** - Clinical Interpretation: synthesis of D into a

factors - Diagnostic Impression: primary and secondary diagnoses with
DSM/ICD codes where appropriate - Progress Evaluation: response to
treatment, trends vs. baseline, symptom trajectory - Risk and Safety
Assessment: suicide/homicide risk, self-care ability - Functional
Assessment: impact on work, relationships, ADLs

techniques planned - Treatment Adjustments: medication changes,
frequency/intensity of sessions, added services - Measurable Goals:
short-term and long-term objectives and how they will be measured -
Referrals and Orders: labs, imaging, specialty consults - Follow-Up:
next appointment, monitoring intervals, crisis instructions

(both short-term and long-term) - SMART Objectives: specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound targets - Baseline
Measures: starting values (symptom scores, functional status) - Role
and Responsibility: who is responsible for each goal (patient,
provider, caregiver)

**I -- Intervention** - Clinical Techniques: exact strategies to be
used (CBT exercises, exposure work, skills training, family therapy)
- Therapeutic Modality: individual, group, couples, telehealth,

session, motivation and readiness - Behavioral Changes: observed or
reported changes, skill acquisition, adherence to homework - Objective
Measures: change scores on validated scales, functional gains - Barriers
and Facilitators: engagement issues, social determinants, supports

**P -- Plan** - Ongoing Treatment Plan: next steps aligned to goals,
timelines, and responsible parties - Adjustments: planned changes
based on response (increase/decrease intensity, add modalities) -
Homework and Skill Practice: assigned exercises with success metrics
- Follow-Up Schedule: appointments, check-ins, monitoring and
contingency plans for risk
